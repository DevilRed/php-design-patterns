# PHP - Design Patterns

This repository was created for the course [COURSE NAME HERE] on Udemy.
We do not have any dependency on a framework, and the examples are the most real as possible based on my own experiences solving real-life problems. Once you learn the design pattern and its concept, it will be effortless to apply it in any PHP project.

## Dependencies

- Docker

## Running the project

I strongly recommend that you follow the course instructions and run it with Docker. It will be much easier, and you need to install Docker on your computer, independent of the OS you are using.
With a few commands, you will run/test all the Design Patterns implemented through the course.

```# docker run design-patterns php -v```

```# docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/app design-patterns bash```
